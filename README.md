## 🎮 How to Play

**Objective:**
Construct a mathematical equation using your cards to get a result as close as possible to **1 (Low)** or **20 (High)**.

### Game Flow

1. **Ante:** Everyone pays a fixed ante to start.
2. **Deal:** Get number cards and math operators (`+`, `-`, `÷`).
   - _Special cards:_ `√` (Square Root) and `×` (Multiply).
3. **Bet:** Raise, call, or fold like in poker.
4. **Showdown:** Arrange your cards to make an equation targeting 1 or 20.

### Winning the Pot

- **Target 1 (Low):** Closest result to 1 wins half the pot.
- **Target 20 (High):** Closest result to 20 wins half the pot.
- **Swing:** Declare **BOTH** Low and High! You must win both sides to take the entire pot (high risk, high reward).
